IDOR ==> Insucre Direct Object Reference
Example-1: 
Girish Account ID = 100
  > To delete ID 100 ==> Should Work
  > To delete ID 101/99/other ==> Shouldn't work ==> bcz, it not your account

Example-2:
You are Guest 
  > Viewing post ID 5 ==> Should work (bcz, of view permissions)
  > Editing post ID 5 ==> Shouldn't wprk(bcz, not authorised to do that)
  
Note: For finding the IDOR, you dpo not need to know lot about how websites are built and how they work. So this would be best to start with.

What do you need 3 things to find the IDOR:
1. Patience
2. Patience
3. Patience

Tools needed: Burp Suite

What to do?:
> When you see an ID, alter the ID number and check the results.
> Try that with privilage user; with guest account etc.,

What is security Impact: Users can do something they shouldn't be able to do

How to find them?:
1.Find endpoints with IDs in the request
2. Chnage the ID ( to another ID that you won); Discalimer: Do not test on real accounts :-)
3. If it works ==> It's an IDOR
======
1. Find endpoints that require admin permissions
2. Login to an account that has guest permissions
3. repeat the requets to the admin end points, chnaging the cookies
4. If that works ==> it's an IDOR

Steps to find:
1. Craete 2 accounts (A, B)
A => victim
B=> attacker
2. Crate an account/Task/post/blog using user "A" account and get the ID number.
3. Do the same for user B
4. Turn on BURP. Intercet the request
5. In user B > click on delete and you would find the ID on BURP.
6. Modify the ID nu, with the user A's ID num

If that works ==> It's an IDOR
